        state_size: Number of units in each LSTM cell's hidden state
        phy_size: Number of features in the input data (drivers) used for UNsupervised learning. These data should be unnormalized.

        ec_threshold: Tolerance for energy imbalance before any penalization occurs
        plam: Physics constraint lambda, a hyperparameter that needs manual tuning. PRESENTLY IGNORED (no physics constraint)
